You must use a *zester* in order to avoid getting any of that bitter rind, and when you zest the lemons, zest them onto some sugar from the recipe (the sugar will 'catch' all of the oils).  I also advise you from personal experience to use only the best skinned lemons for the best flavor.",

This is an &quot;authentic&quot; Alfredo sauce recipe! Real Alfredo sauce *only* contains butter, cream, Parmesan cheese and pepper. It will be thin and there is no garlic in it! If you want a thicker sauce or one with garlic like modern restaurants serve, please look elsewhere! Recipe #52892 and Recipe #8596 are two good places to start.",

I consider this 'perfect' chocolate cake. This cake is excellent with  both with Recipe #261024 and Recipe #208959 (the dark flavor version). (I use Recipe #95416 when I'm decorating the cake.) I love how the leftovers are still moist even a day or two later. (I store my loosely covered with plastic wrap.)\nMy father adores this cake with Recipe #261024 on it. For his birthday, Father's Day etc. I make him cupcakes with the icing on them and individually wrap them. He keeps them in his freezer for when he wants &quot;a piece of cake&quot;. He claims they are as good as when they are fresh. \n(Even though it isn't where I got the recipe from so I can't vouch for it, reviewers have said it is the recipe on the Hershey's cocoa can.

Prep time does not include the time it takes to pit the cherries or make the pie crust. ;) I use the Pie Crust recipe in the Fanny Farmer Baking Book. Recipe #13619 is the recipe for 2 8-inch crust. (I've found I have to refrigerate it for the pie filling to firm up and not be &quot;soupy&quot; when it has cooled. Once it has completely chilled, you can store it at room temperature and it doesn't lose its firmness. Or, store it in the fridge and warm it in the microwave a little bit before serving it with ice cream or whipped cream if desired.)",

Again, the bird turned out perfect.  Growing up, I hated white meat because it was always dry and grinding on your teeth ;-), now I love white meat.  Cook time includes the brining time.",
