            "Description": "This is from one of my  first Good House Keeping cookbooks.  You must use a *zester* in order to avoid getting any of that bitter rind, and when you zest the lemons, zest them onto some sugar from the recipe (the sugar will 'catch' all of the oils).  I also advise you from personal experience to use only the best skinned lemons for the best flavor.",

Stir in tomatoes, tomato paste,  wine, parsley, seasonings and sugar.\", \"Reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered,  for 30-45 minutes, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid has evaporated, and the mixture is quite thick. Remove skillet from heat and let it  cool completely.\", \"Start seasoning the eggplants: peel eggplants and slice vertically, 1/8 to 1/4  inch thick. Sprinkle lightly with salt and let sit for 30 minutes.\", \n\"Now make the  Bechamel Sauce.  NOTE:  The Bechamel-egg-ricotta mixture will overflow all but the largest  (professional size) food processors. Use a mixer or blend by hand.Place the milk in a saucepan, and heat it just until tiny  bubbles appear along the edges. Remove and set aside.\", \"Melt the butter in 3-quart saucepan over very low heat until foamy, being careful not to brown. Slowly add the 6 Tbsp flour, stirring constantly until smooth (3-4 minutes), and  still being careful not to let it brown.\", \n\"Add the milk slowly, whipping with a wire whisk. When the mixture is thick and smooth, remove it from the heat and stir in seasonings.\", \"Stir ricotta cheese until it is smooth  and creamy. Gently fold it into the Bechamel sauce. Stir in beaten eggs until  thoroughly incorporated.\", \"Back to the eggplant: Rinse well with cold water; squeeze gently and pat dry. Dredge the eggplant in 1 1/2 cups flour, and saute each in olive oil until it is  brown on both sides.\", \"Remove and discard any excess oil that has risen to the  top of the tomato mixture. Lightly grease a 16x10 baking pan that is at least 3  inches deep, and sprinkle the bottom with a few breadcrumbs.\", \n\"Place a layer of  eggplant in the pan, following with a layer of tomato mixture. Sprinkle with  breadcrumbs and grated cheese. Repeat as many times as you have eggplant to  last. Pour the Bechamel-ricotta sauce over the top and bake at 300 deg. F for  one hour, or until a golden-brown crust has formed on top.\", \"Remove moussaka from  oven and let it stand undisturbed 20-30 minutes; the delay allows the layers to  fuse.\", \"\")"
